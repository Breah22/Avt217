		<h1>Good Restaurant Website Critiques</h1>

				 The layout is simple and clear. There is a white background and a consistent red color theme that matches the logo which makes the website look attractive to the eye. There is not too much color on this website to distract the user from their initial motives. The high-quality pictures of food that the restaurant offers is an excellent touch to website. Customers are there to order food so why not make the food look really appetizing. I love that the headers on this website are a daker red and bold. It is very easy to navigate through this site.

				My first initial thought when I went this website was, “yep, this is Chick-fil-A’s website for sure”. The white background with the bright red color scheme has always been their thing and it works for them. Chick-fil-a has always been a company filled with lovely employees, good energy, and good food. Red is a color of love and passion, so it matches the spirit of the restaurant. One thing I think they could change is the small font on the headers.

				The color scheme of the website fits the restaurants theme so well. The burgundy red, grey and off-white color is the perfect choice for the Australian theme of the restaurant. They bring a sense of reliability and professionalism to the website. Very nice quality pictures. The pictures are very attractive and will encourage the costumers to order more food. The layout is very effective and easy to find information on it.

				From first impression, this is a very clean website that is user-friendly. The use of pure white in the background makes the orange pop. Good choice of colors on this website. Orange is a color that users gravitate to and its also symbolizes homecooked food. Orange screams soul food. This food chain is trying to be more of a family style restaurant that puts love into all their food so the use of this color works. The layout is very nice and is not too busy.

				Panda Express’s website is another company that uses the color red. It seems that red is the most common color used in the food industry. The layout of this website is simple but very effective and not too complicated for the user to navigate. I like how their logo is in the left corner of the website. It does not distract the user from the content. One thing they could do is have better quality images of their food.
